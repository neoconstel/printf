# printf implementation (language: C)
The goal is to implement a custom printf function, called _printf, which can 
print variables in string format according to the directive of the format 
specifiers (%d, %c, %s etcetera).

## Milestones Achieved
- _printf function working as expected: Prints a string and uses the format
specifiers to interpret it into its appropriate string value by fetching the 
corresponding vaue from the variable arguments.

- replace putchar() with write() completely

- _printf returns the number of characters printed


## TODOs
- remove the main function
 
- separate functions into header files
 
- if required, reduce number of functions
 
- tuck global variables into functions
