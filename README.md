# printf implementation

## Milestones
- _printf function working as expected: Prints a string and used the format
specifiers to interpret it into its appropriate string by fetching the 
corresponding vaue from the variable arguments.

## TODOs
- remove the main function
 
- separate functions into header files
 
- replace putchar() with write() completely
 
- if required, reduce number of functions
 
- tuck global variables into functions
 
- _printf should return the number of characters printed
